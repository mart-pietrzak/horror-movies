### Or how I queried my way into the ultimate Halloween movie night

Every year, my friends and I go on a Halloween retreat. Sometimes it's a remote cabin in the woods, other times a luxurious spa experience with extra goosbumps. But no matter where we go - there's one question that needs to be answered. What are the best horror movies to watch this spook season?

If you'd like to partake in my recommendations, head into the project SQL file and check out my queries.
